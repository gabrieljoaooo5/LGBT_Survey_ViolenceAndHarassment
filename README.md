## Project

In this project, I will analyze a survey about violence and harassment against LGBTQIA+ people. The goal of the project is to answer these three questions below:
- What are the most dangerous places for LGBTQIA+ people?
- Who usually is the perpetrator?
- Did the victims usually report it to the police? If the answer is no, why not?
